# README

The scripts show some random queries which aren't structured for anything in particular. If we'd had time in the session I would have liked to demonstrate `SMALLDATETIME` and why it's not a great data type, for example.

(Spoiler: it only goes up to the year 2079.)

The slides are almost the same as they were in the session - I've removed one animation, as well as the final slide. If you need to get hold of me, you can do so on https://bornsql.ca.
