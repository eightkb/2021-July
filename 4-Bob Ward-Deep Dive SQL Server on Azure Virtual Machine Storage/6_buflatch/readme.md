# Looking at BUF latches

## Debugging BUF latches

1. Bring up bufsandpages.sql and follow the comments in the script
2. Now let's attach the debugger and try to look at the BUF structure in memory (without using private symbols). The memory address of the BUF is at the top of the DBCC PAGE output where it says BUF @<address>
3. Run `dd <buf address>`
4. Notice the first 8 bytes matches bpage from DBCC page (byte swapped)
- Now run `dd <bpage address>`
- This is the actual database PFS page in memory
5. Look at bytes <buf address>+0x90
7. 52 bytes down is the start of the Latch class. This is actually 0x80 or 128 bytes from the start of the BUF structure. There is another way to find this when there is BUF latch waiting. Use the resource_address from dm_os_waiting_tasks.
8. Notice that most of the class appears to be 0 values. Why? That is because there is no waiters, no owner, and the latch class is 0.
9. 24 more bytes from the start of this is the Latch class ID. This value is 0x1c which in decimal is 28 (Hint. type in ?1c in the debugger to get the decimal equivalent).What is this value? This ID is the index into the list of latch classes in the code.
10. Run `.detach` from the debug command window and `q`
11. Run the query in find_latch_class_buf.sql to learn how to translate a latch class ID into a "name"

## Using the new page functions in T-SQL

1. Run gobaylors.sql to create the database
2. Load pageinfo.sql and execrequests.sql
3. Run insertbears.cmd
4. Obsearve the output execrequests.sql and in pageinfo.sql
